            An innocuous seeming deck of Cards. Each card simply has an image drawn on it in a simple style. Pulling from the deck will result in an event involving the person drawing (henceforth ‘the drawer’), such as the appearance of an object, an effect influencing the drawer, or a creature appearing. These effects can be either positive, negative, or neutral. Only 1 card can be drawn a day.
