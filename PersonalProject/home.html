            <h3>Overview</h3>

            <p id="paragraph">
                ‘Niev’ is the homebrew setting for a Dungeons and Dragons campaign some of my friends and I have been playing for the last several years. The island of Niev is isolated, surrounded by a churning storm, shipwreaking those who dared to venture into it and trapping those already within. Three nations dominate the land, the necromatically inclined humans, the dwarves of the Diamond Mountains, and the shrewd, eccentric elves. <br>So, what happens when a few idiots with godlike powers roll a nat 20 on a charisma check? <br>
                This project was an excellent excuse to start orginizing information better surrounding the campaign.
