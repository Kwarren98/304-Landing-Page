        <p>Only 600 years ago the ship the Kul’Tira managed to make its way through the storm surrounding Niev and became shipwrecked upon the shore. The surviving crew, only 20 strong, were immediately beset by a dwarvish battalion . Faced with no other choice, the only wizard on the ship, Eliza Rosa, turned to necromancy to raise their fallen brethren. With the power of undeath on their side, the crew managed to create a colony on the western shoreline. Soon they expanded into a thriving nation, which they called Kul’Tira. Kul’Tira is ruled by a King and a Court Necromancer. Necromancy is ingrained in Kul’Tiran culture, with every town having at least 2-3 necromancers. The dead do the hard labor and form the bulk of their military force. However, Eric Ainsworth, the current Court Necromancer, feels that Necromancy will ultimately cause more harm than good in Kul’Tira. As such, he has declared that Necromancy as a common practice will be phased out over the next few hundred years. This has led to revolts across the country as groups of necromancers fight to save their livelihood and culture. 
            Kul’Tira’s rapid expansion across the western fields and forests has led them into direct conflict with the Dwarves of Erztäger. Several bloody wars were fought between the two forces, but the humans ultimately managed to push the dwarves back to the mountains. At this current time, Kul’Tira controls the entirety of the south-western area of Niev, right up to the Gate of Berghang. However, Kul’Tira enjoys a healthy trading relationship with the elves to the east.
